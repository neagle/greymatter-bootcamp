# Industry Profile and Challenges

The benefits are clear: while a monolithic architecture is hard to develop and maintain, an API- and microservice-based architecture allows for greater agility, is easier to maintain, and is less costly in the long run.

::right::

The global microservices architecture market was valued at $3.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach
**$6.62 billion by 2030**.

However, microservices canâ€™t function alone and they often work together to compose larger applications. The integration patterns to accomplish these interactions have evolved from traditional hub-and-spoke enterprise application integration (EAI) to service-oriented architecture (SOA) and, now, to a more API-led approach.

::right::

This leads to 3 main challenges that must be addressed:

1. Secure communications across services and domains
2. Traffic control and fault tolerance
3. Management and Monitoring
